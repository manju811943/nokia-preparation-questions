46. How to Prevent XSS (Interview Answer)

✔ Escape user input
✔ Avoid innerHTML
✔ Use Angular built-in sanitization
✔ Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
✔ Validate input

	=> XSS is a client-side attack where malicious scripts are injected into web pages and executed in the user's browser. It can be prevented using input sanitization and Angular’s built-in template escaping.

	=> CSRF is an attack where a logged-in user's browser is tricked into sending unauthorized requests to a trusted server. It is prevented using CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, or by using token-based authentication like JWT instead of cookies.
	
	
47. what is an Angular library ?

		Common Header/Footer
		Custom Validators
		
	steps :
			steps 1:
				=> ng generate library shared-ui
				
				=> projects/
					 └── shared-ui/
						 └── src/
							 └── lib/
								 ├── shared-ui.module.ts
								 ├── shared-ui.component.ts
									
			step 2 : generate component inside the library
				=> ng g component button --project=shared-ui

			step 3: Export Component From Library Module
			
			step 4 : ng build shared-ui  => dist/shared-ui/ -> this deployable
			
			step 5 : Version Your Library  
				=> in the - projects/shared-ui/package.json -> "version" : "1.0.0"
				
			step 6 : Publish Internally (3 Enterprise Options)
			
					Option 1:  Private NPM Registry (Recommended) -> 1. Nexus
								=> publish => npm publish
								=> install in any project => npm install @company/shared-ui
						
					Option 2:  Git Based Installation (Quick Setup)
								=> npm install git+https://github.com/company/shared-ui-lib.git
								
					Option 3 : Local Tar Package (Offline Mode)
								=> npm pack -> It will create .tqz file 
								=> npm install shared-ui-1.0.0.tgz

						
															 
															
			
			Step 6: Use Library in Your Application
				
				import { SharedUiModule } from 'shared-ui';

					@NgModule({
					  imports: [
						SharedUiModule
					  ]
					})
					export class AppModule { }
					
			step 6 : Use Library Component in Any Component HTML
				=> <lib-button></lib-button>

	=> param versioning
	
	
	
40. Integration of Microservice to open source software system :
	common open source software system
		Messaging		-> kafka, RabbidMQ
		Cache 			-> Redis, EH cache
		API gateway 	-> Nginx
		logging 		-> ELK
		
		
		so, connecting your sprinboot Microservcie to open source platfrom, to send, receive, process, moniter, or stored the data
		Eg: publish event to Kafka
			store data in Redis cache
			
		=> for Network Management system :
			your springboot app will communicate with NMS platform to fetch metrics, send alerts, push data, or automate network operations
			Eg: openNMS
			
		
41. Code Review :
	=> code quality  (unnecessary loops, multiple database queries, input validation and sensitive data handling)
	=> security aspects
	=> Maintainbility
	=> performce consideration
	=> Functionality & Business Logic
	=> code readability and clean code
	=> Exception handling
	=> Test coverage
	
	=> Reusability and Scalability
	=> Naming conventions
	=> code duplication
	 
	
42. Ethernet :
	it is communication protocal that defines how data transmitted over wired networkd using cable such LAN cable
	
	
43. Swing :
	swing is a part of java foundation class that privide componets to create platforms independent desktop based apps
	
	
44. what is live lock ?
	=> live lock is situation where threads are active and running, but no actual progress is made beacsue they keep resposnidng each other.
		=> Threads are not blocked
		=> threads are not waiting
		=> CPU is being used
		=> but no work is getting completed
		
	=> How to prevent :
		=> add random time for retrying
		=> limit retry attempt
		=> better lock strategy
		=> avoid busy waiting.  wait(), notify()
		
45. What is Parrallel streams :
	=> allow stream operation to run parallel using multiple threads to improve performce for large appln
	Eg: list.parallelStream().forEach(n-> sout(n))  => Note : order is not guaranteed.
		=> improve CPU usage								 use forEachOrdered() if order needed
		=> multiple threads
		=> faster heavy loads.
		

45. Diff between :

	DeadLock 							Live Lock
	thread are blocked					thread are running
	waiting forever						actively retrying
	No CPU usage						High CPU usage
	Resource locked						No Resource lock
	
	
46. Both Comparable and Comparator are used for object sorting in Java.
	=> Comparable Inteface:
	
		=> used to define natural ordering sort
		=> has only one method -> compareTo(Object o)
		
			Eg: class Employee implemets Comarable<Employee>{
			
				priavte Integer id;
				private Sring name;
				
				Employee(Integer id, String name){
					this.id = id;
					this.name = name;
				}
				
				public int compareTo(Employee e){
					return this.id = e.id;
				}
				}
				
	=> Comparator Interface
		=> Used to define external sorting logic
		=> create mutliple sorting logics
		=> have one method -> compare(Object o1, Object o2);
		
		Eg: public class NameComparator implemets Comparator<Employee>{
		
			public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2){
				return e1.name.compareTo(e2.name);
			}
		}
		
		
47. FlatMap : examples
	Eg 1: 
		List<List<String>> list = Arrays.asList(
                Arrays.asList("java", "python"),
                Arrays.asList("Angular", "react"),
                Arrays.asList("js", "php")
        );

        list.stream().flatMap(l-> l.stream()).forEach(n-> System.out.println(n));
		
	Eg 2 :
	 List<List<Integer>> numbers = Arrays.asList(
                Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3),
                Arrays.asList(3, 4, 5),
                Arrays.asList(5, 6, 7)
        );

        List<Integer> num = numbers.stream().flatMap(l-> l.stream()).distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println(num);
		
		
48. Java 17 feature :
	=> Sealed class
	=> Records (FINAL) -> USed to create immutable data class automatically
		Eg: public Record Employee(int id, String name);
	=> Text Blocks (FINAL) -> multip line string without \n 
		Eg: String json = """ 
				{
					"name":"Ram"
				}
			"""
		
	=> Encapsulation -> Improved performance
	=> Switch Expression
	
	
49. Java 21 features :
	=> Virtual Threads (FINAL) -> It make highily scalable concurant application
		Benefits :
			=> millions of thread
			=> less memory usage
			=> ideal of Rest API
			=> Perfect for micorservcue
			
	=> Record Patterns (FINAL) -> Destructure records objects easily
	
	=> String Templates 
		Eg: String name = "Ram";
			String msge = STR."Hello \{name}"
	=> Unnamed Classes & Instance Main
		Eg : void main(){
				sout("");
			}
			
50. Records :
	=> A Records is used to create a data carrier class that automatically provides: or creating immutable data objects.
		=> Constrotor
		=> Getters
		=> equals()
		=> hashCode()
		=> toString()
		=> immutable fields
	
51. List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "avacado", "banana", "brinjal", "cat");
        System.out.println(list.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(n-> n.charAt(0))));
		
		o/p : {a=[apple, avacado], b=[banana, brinjal], c=[cat]}
		
		
52. String s1 = "ABC";
    String s2 = "ACD";

    String s3 = s1.concat(s2);

        Set<String> s4 = new HashSet<>();


        System.out.println(Arrays.stream(s3.split(""))
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(),Collectors.counting()))
                .entrySet()
                .stream().filter(ele-> ele.getValue() > 1)
                .map(e-> e.getKey())
                .collect(Collectors.joining()));  // AC
				
				
53. Find indices whose sum equals target.

	Example
	[2,7,11,15], target=9
		
		int arr[] = {2,17,11,7}; // target=9
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++) {
                if(arr[i] + arr[j] == 9){
                    System.out.println(arr[i]  + " " + arr[j]);
                }
            }
        }
		
		
54. count the character frequency and print them in acsending of their values

		Eg:  String str = "banana";
			 Arrays.stream(str.split(""))
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function. identity(), Collectors.counting()))
                .entrySet().stream()
                .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue())
                .forEach(n-> System.out.println(n));
				
				
55. print all the subtring of given string

	 String str = "ABC";

        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j <= str.length(); j++) {
                System.out.println(str.substring(i,j));
            }
        }  
		   o/p  A
				AB
				ABC
				B
				BC
				C
	
56. You want to fetch 20 records starting from the 5th row and return only first name and last name.

	SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM users
	LIMIT 20 OFFSET 4;
	
57. What is Lookups
	=> Lookup means quickly finding a value or record using a key or reference.
	
		eg 1: Programming Example (Java Map Lookup)
				Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
				map.put(101, "Manju");
				map.put(102, "Rahul");

				// Lookup
				System.out.println(map.get(101));
				
		eg 2: Database Lookup Example (SQL)
			SELECT name 
			FROM employee 
			WHERE emp_id = 101;
			
			👉 emp_id = 101 is the lookup key
			
			
58. How Springboot App works and do thing internally automatically
	
		Simulating in plain java as below :
		
		🚀 SpringBootSimulator.java
			
			import java.util.*;

			class HelloController {

				public String hello() {
					return "Hello World from Spring Boot Simulation";
				}
			}

		public class SpringBootSimulator {

			public static void main(String[] args) {

				System.out.println("Starting Application...");

				// Step 1: Create IOC Container
				Map<String, Object> container = new HashMap<>();

				// Step 2: Create Bean
				HelloController controller = new HelloController();
				container.put("helloController", controller);

				// Step 3: URL Mapping
				Map<String, String> urlMapping = new HashMap<>();
				urlMapping.put("/hello", "helloController");

				// Step 4: Simulate Request
				String requestUrl = "/hello";

				HelloController bean =
						(HelloController) container.get(urlMapping.get(requestUrl));

				String response = bean.hello();

				System.out.println("Response: " + response);
		}
	}

59. If multiple interfaces have the same default method and a class implements both, Java will NOT automatically choose one. 
	
	=> It causes compile-time error.
	
	=> Choose One Interface Explicitly
		
		class Test implements A, B {
			@Override
			public void show() {
				A.super.show();   // Calls A's method
			}
		}
		
60. Pre-Processor and Post-Processor diff
	=> Pre-Processor : 
		1. 👉 A Pre-Processor is something that executes BEFORE the main logic/action/request is processed.
			Examples:
				Authentication check
				Request validation
				Logging request data
				Adding headers
				
	==> Post-Processor : 👉 A Post-Processor runs AFTER the main logic/action/request is completed.
			Used for:
				Logging response
				Modifying response
				Cleanup tasks
				Auditing


61. ✅ What is @ConfigProperty?
			
	==> @ConfigProperty is used to read configuration values from external sources like :
		application.properties
		environemnt varibale
		system properties
		

62. ✅ What is CompletableFuture?
	==>  CompletableFuture is java classs used to perform asyncrnous , non blobking, opeartion ans handle result when they become avaibale
	
	=>  ✔ Non-blocking
		✔ Callback based
		✔ Better performance
		
	=> ✅ Important Methods (Interview Must-Know)
		1. runAsync() → No Return Value
		2. supplyAsync() → Returns Value
		3. thenApply() → Transform Result
		4. thenAccept() → Consume Result
		5. thenRun() → No Input No Output


63. ✅ What is Saga Pattern?
	==> Saga pattern is used to manage distiurbited transction across the multiple micorsevices by using  a sequential local transction	
	
		✅ Flow (Choreography)
			Order Service
				↓ (OrderCreated Event)
			Payment Service
				↓ (PaymentCompleted Event)
			Inventory Service
			
		❌ Failure Case
			Inventory Failed
			  ↓
			Payment Service → Refund Event
			  ↓
			Order Service → Cancel Order
			
			
64. OOPS:
	==> Encapsulation – Data Hiding & Protection
		-> Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class) 
			and restricting direct access to the data
			
			Eg: Bank Account
					You cannot directly access balance
					You must use deposit() / withdraw()
					
			✅ Benefits
				Improves security
				Controls how data is modified
				Easier maintenance
				
	==> Inheritance – Code Reusability
		-> Inheritance allows a child class to acquire properties and behavior of a parent class.
			
			Eg: Bank Account
					you have Gold accont class have some intrest calculate method
					same can used in Slilver account class
			
	==> Polymorphism – One Thing, Many Forms
		-> Same method name but different behavior depending on the object.
				
				Types :
					Compile-time (Method Overloading)
  					Run-time (Method Overriding)
					
			Eg : Payment Method
					pay() → Card
					pay() → UPI
					pay() → Cash
	
	==> Abstraction – Hide Implementation Details
		-> Showing only essential features and hiding internal logic.
			
			payment and sendSMS these will just give us methods, 
			not expose the implementation
			
65. 🔹 Why static methods cannot be overridden?
			Overriding depends on runtime polymorphism, and:
			Static methods belong to the class
			They are resolved at compile time, not runtime
			So dynamic method dispatch does NOT apply to static methods.
			
		🔹 What actually happens? → Method Hiding
			If a child class defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the parent class, it is called method hiding, not overriding.
			
66. 🔹 How ExecutorService Works in Java (Step-by-Step)
	
	==> ExecutorService is part of the java.util.concurrent package and is used to manage and execute multiple threads efficiently 
		without creating threads manually.
			
		1️. Problem Without ExecutorService
			❌ Problems:
				Too many threads → OutOfMemoryError
				No control over thread lifecycle
				Poor performance due to frequent thread creation
			
		2️. What ExecutorService Does
				ExecutorService:
				Creates a thread pool
				Accepts tasks (Runnable / Callable)
				Assigns tasks to available threads
				Manages queueing, reuse, and shutdown
		
		
67. JOINS in SQL

	=> 1️. INNER JOIN – Matching Records Only
		=> Returns rows only when there is a match in both tables.
		
	=> 2️. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
		=> Returns all rows from left table + matching rows from right table.
	
	=> 3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
		=> Returns all rows from right table + matching rows from left table.
		
	=> 4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
		=> Returns all records from both tables
		   Non-matching rows contain NULL
		   
	=> 5. CROSS JOIN – Cartesian Product
		=> Returns all possible combinations.
	
	=> 6. SELF JOIN in SQL (with Real-Time Examples)
	
		=> A SELF JOIN is when a table is joined with itself.
			-> when table having emp_id,  name, manager_id
			
			Eg : SELECT 
					e.name AS employee,
					m.name AS manager
				FROM Employee e
				LEFT JOIN Employee m
				ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;

		
	🎯 Real-Time Interview Use Cases
		INNER JOIN → Active users with orders
		LEFT JOIN → Customers without orders
		RIGHT JOIN → Products not sold
		SELF JOIN → Employee-Manager hierarchy
		FULL JOIN → Data reconciliation
		
68. How do you handle configuration changes without redeploying all services?

	=> Centralized Configuration Server (Most Common)
	
		How it works
			Store configs in Git / Vault / S3
			All services read config from a central config server
			Config changes do not require redeployment
		
	=> Dynamic Refresh (@RefreshScope)
	
		Allows beans to reload configuration at runtime.
			@RefreshScope
			@Component
			public class PaymentConfig {
				@Value("${payment.timeout}")
				private int timeout;
			}
			
	=> Environment Variables (Container-Friendly)
			Very common in Docker & Kubernetes.
	
	=> Feature Flags / Toggles (Business Config)
	
		if(featureFlagService.isEnabled("NEW_PAYMENT_FLOW")) {
			newFlow();
			} else {
				oldFlow();
		}
		
	=> Database-Stored Configuration
	
69. How do you trace a single request across multiple microservices?

	=> ✅ Solution: Distributed Tracing
			Key Idea
				Generate a unique Trace ID for each request
				Pass it across all microservices
				Collect timing & metadata
				Visualize the complete request flow

70. How do you secure service-to-service communication?
	=> JWT and OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials Flow)
	=> API Gateway as Security Gatekeeper
	=> Service Mesh (Zero-Trust Model)
		=> Service mesh automates security without code changes.
			What it provides
				Automatic mTLS
				Identity-based access
				Traffic policies
				✔ Strongest security model
				✔ Transparent to developers
					
				
71. How many String Objects will be created for String s1 = new String("ankit");
	=> ✅ Answer: 2 String objects are created
	
		-> "ankit" ->  This literal is checked in the String Constant Pool.
					   If "ankit" is not already present, one object is created in the SCP.
				
		-> new String("ankit") -> The new keyword always creates a new object in the heap.
	
72. 🔹 What is a Page Object ?

	=> A page object is java class that represent one web page (screen) of application
		
	=> It contains:
		Locators (buttons, inputs, links)
		Page-level actions (click, type, submit)
		Business methods related to that page
	
	=> 🎯 Purpose of Page Objects
			1️. Separation of Concerns
				Test classes → test flow & validation
				Page classes → UI elements & actions
				
73. Your Spring Boot app works locally but fails after deployment. What do you check first?

	=> Application Logs (Most Important)
	=> Environment & Configuration Mismatch
	=> Port & Server Configuration
	=> Database Connectivity
	=> Packaging & Build Issues
	=> External Dependencies
	=> Java & Runtime Version Mismatch
	=> Security & CORS Issues (If UI works locally)
	=> Enable actuator health
	

74. | Feature     | HashMap    	| LinkedHashMap        | TreeMap        |
	| ----------- | ----------  | -----------------    | -------------- |
	| Ordering    | ❌ No       | ✅ Insertion order   | ✅ Sorted order |
	| Internal DS | Hash Table  | Hash Table + DLL     | Red-Black Tree |
	| Performance | ⭐ Fastest  | ⭐⭐ Medium         | ⭐ Slowest      |
	| Null Key    | ✅ One      | ✅ One              | ❌ Not allowed  |
	| Null Values | ✅ Allowed  | ✅ Allowed          | ✅ Allowed      |
	| Thread-safe | ❌ No       | ❌ No               | ❌ No           |
	
	=> HashMap fails when order or thread safety is required, 
	=> LinkedHashMap fails in memory-critical systems, 
	=> TreeMap fails with null keys, bad comparators, or when high performance is needed.
	
	
	
75. Behaviour of  HashMap in Multi-threaded env.
	=> 👉 HashMap is NOT thread-safe.
			Using it concurrently without synchronization can lead to data corruption, 
			lost updates, exceptions, and (in older Java) infinite loops.
			
	🔴 What goes wrong with HashMap in multi-threading?
		1. Data Inconsistency (Lost Updates)
		2. Internal Structure Corruption (Very Dangerous)
		3. ConcurrentModificationException (Fail-Fast)
		4. Visibility Issues
		5. NullPointerException (Rare but Real) => During concurrent resize, a thread may read a partially updated bucket.
		

76. 🔹 What is Method Hiding in Java?

	=> Method hiding happens when a subclass declares a static method with the same name and parameters 
		as a static method in the parent class.
		
		class Parent {
			static void show() {
				System.out.println("Parent show()");
			}
		}

		class Child extends Parent {
			static void show() {
				System.out.println("Child show()");
			}
		}
	
	
77. What is @Lazy?

	=> 🔍 What @Lazy Changes 
			Bean is NOT created at startup
			Bean is created only when first requested
			Improves startup performance
	
	
==============================================================

		 strongPasswordValidator(){
			return (control: AbstractControl)=> {
			  const value = control.value;
			  if(!value){
				return null;
			  }

			  const strong = 
			  /[A_Z]/.test(value) &&
			  /[a-z]/.test(value) &&
			  /[0-9]/.test(value) &&
			  value.length >= 8;

			  return strong;

9. How do you manage shared state withiut NgRx ?

	=> private dataSubject = new BehaviorSubject(null);
	=> data$ = this.dataSubject.asObservable();

	=> setData(val : any){
		this.dataSubject.next(val);
		}
		
	| Subject                    | BehaviorSubject     |
	| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
	| No initial value           | Needs initial value |
	| Late subscribers miss data | Gets last value     |
	
10. How does NgRX works internally ?
	=> Component → Action → Reducer → Store → Selector → Component

11. How to create custom directive for allowOnlyNumbner in input

	=> @HostListener('input', ['$event'])
		onInput(event:any) {
		  event.target.value =
			event.target.value.replace(/[^0-9]/g,'');
		}

20. UI Not Updating After API Response
	=> Because of UI doesnt't refresh
		=> onPush changeDetection + mutated Object
		
		Eg: this.user.name = "Roy"  ❌ Wrong
			this.user = {...this.user, name:'Roy'}; ✅ Correct
			
21. API flooding ?
	=> typing search box send api request for every key press
	
		Eg : valueChnages.pipe(
			debounrcTime(300),
			distinctUntilChnage(),
			switchMap(val -> api.search(val))
		)

22. API Race Condition Bug
	=> user switch filter faster -> wrong data appears
		
	✅ Fix => use switchMap (cancel previous request)
	
23. Dynamic Component Memory Leak

	=> container.destroy()
	
24. Micro Frontend Angular App Communication
	=> custom events
	=> shared Store
	=> shared service worker
	
25. switchMap Output
	of(1,2,3).pipe(
		switchMap(val -> val * 10);
	).subscribe( val -> console.log(val))
	
	
26. dynamic form fields
	=> this.form.push(
		new FomrControl('',[]);
		)
		
27. Global Error Handling using HTTp interceptor
	=> intercept(req,next){
		return next.handle(req).pipe(
			catchError(err-> {
				alert("something went wrong!")
				return throwErr(err)
			})
		)
	}
	
28. how do you expose and consume and communicate Api ?
	=> Using Rest Controllers we are exposing APIs
	
	=> Using RestTemple, webclient, Feign Client we consume API
	
	=> communication 2 ways -> sync and async
	
29. DIff between RestTemplate and Webclient
	
	Rest Template = Request → Thread waits → Response arrives → Continue
	Web Client = Request → Thread free → Response callback → Process

	
	
30. DDL v/s DML real time use case	

	=> DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to define or modify database structure (schema).
	
	| Command  | Purpose                             |
	| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
	| CREATE   | Create table/database               |
	| ALTER    | Modify table structure              |
	| DROP     | Delete table                        |
	| TRUNCATE | Remove all rows (structure remains) |
	
	DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to manipulate actual table data.
	
	| Command | Purpose     |
	| ------- | ----------- |
	| INSERT  | Add data    |
	| UPDATE  | Modify data |
	| DELETE  | Remove data |
	| SELECT  | Fetch data  |


	
	
31. Views, procedures, triigers

	👉 What is a View?
	=> These are used to fetch the data from table, a vtirual table can be created using sql queries.
	=> not used to store only fetch
	
	👉 What is Stored Procedure?
	=> A Stored Procedure is a precompiled block of SQL logic stored in database.
	
	👉 What is Trigger?
	=> A Trigger is SQL block of code that automatically excute when an event accurs
		Events:
			INSERT
			UPDATE 
			DELETE
			

32. Where does the Kafka stores the data ?

	=> kafka stores the data on the disk(file system) of the Kafka Broker servers.
	
	Internally 
	-> Each Topic -> split into Partition
	-> Each Partion -> stored as log files on disk
	
	=> Kafka is disk-based (not memory based like Redis)
	
	
33. How does Kafka maintain version ?

	=> Kafka does not use the work version -> it uses Offset
	=> Each message has a unique sequentail offset number
	Eg:
		Partition-0
		--------------
		Offset 0 → Order Created
		Offset 1 → Payment Done
		Offset 2 → Order Shipped
		
		=> Kafka knows which message alreay consumed and what is next
		
34. How long does kafka keep data ?
	
	=> Kafka keeps the data based on Retention policy:
		2 types 
			1. Time based retention -> can configured -> eg: log.retention.hours = 168  ->  once 168 hours done -> Old segments are deleted automatically
			2. size based retention -> can configured -> eg: log.retention.bytes = 10GB ->  If topic exceeds 10GB → old data deleted
			
	
35. Kafka Architecture :

	Producer
		↓
	Kafka Broker (Disk Storage)
		↓
	Consumer

36. how does kafka handle backup/safety ?
	=> Replication factor
		-> replication.factor = 3
		
		| Question                | Answer                       |
		| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
		| Where stored?           | Broker disk (log segments)   |
		| How version maintained? | Using OFFSET                 |
		| How long stored?        | Retention policy (time/size) |
		| Physical location?      | Broker server file system    |
		| Backup?                 | Replication factor           |
		
	=> when you'll get memory execption in kafka ?
			1. Broker-Side Memory Issues (Most Critical)
			
				❌ Huge Message Size -> Producer sends messages larger than broker limits
				❌ Too Many Partitions -> ~2,000–4,000 partitions per broker (depends on RAM)
				❌ High Fetch/Produce Throughput -> Large batches + slow disk/network
				
			2. Consumer-Side Memory Exceptions
				-> Too many records loaded into memory at once
			3. Log Retention & Disk Backpressure
		
37. which design pattern you worked on ?
	🔹 1) Singleton Design Pattern (Most Common)
		=> In Spring, Beans are Singleton by default.
		
				Example:  Spring creates only one object of this class and reuses it.
				
					=> Service classes
					=> Repository classes
					=> Configuration classes
					=> Utility classes

	🔹 2) Factory Design Pattern (Very Important)
		=> Used when object creation logic should be hidden.
		=> We used Factory pattern to create different service implementations dynamically.
		
				Example:
					In your project:
						👉 Payment Service
						👉 Notification Service
						👉 Report Generator
						
	🔹 3) Builder Design Pattern
			
		=> Used when object has many fields.
		
				Example:
					DTO / Request Object creation
					User user = User.builder()
						.name("Roy")
						.age(25)
						.city("Bangalore")
						.build();
						
	🔹 5) Observer Pattern
		=> Used in:
			Kafka consumers
			Event listeners
			Spring Application Events
			
			Example:
				Producer publishes event
				Multiple consumers listen to it.

38. what is volatile key word ? can valatile ensure thread safety ?

	==> The valatile keyword ensure visbility of changes to varible across threads.
	==> Note :  No guarrantee thread safety or atomicity
		
		
39. ✅ What is AWS Lambda ?

	==> AWS lambda is serverless compute service by AWS, that let's you run code without managing servers
	
	==> You only:
	
			=> Upload your code
			=> Configure a trigger
			=> AWS automatically handles scaling, provisioning, patching, and infrastructure
			
	==> 🔗 How AWS Lambda Integrates With Other AWS Services
	
			==> AWS Lambda is event-driven, meaning it is triggered by other AWS services.
				 
				Eg : Client → API Gateway → Lambda → Response
					 File Upload → S3 Event → Lambda
				 
40. ✅ What are Runnable and Callable Interfaces in Java?

	==> 👉 YES — Both Runnable and Callable are Functional Interfaces ✅
	
	==> Runnable : void run();
	
			📌 Key Points
				✔ Does NOT return result
				✔ Cannot throw checked exception
				✔ Used with Thread class or ExecutorService
				✔ Old and simple interface
				
			Eg : class MyTask implements Runnable {
					public void run() {
						System.out.println("Task running...");
					}
				}

				public class Main {
					public static void main(String[] args) {
						Thread t = new Thread(new MyTask());
						t.start();
					}
					}
	==> Callable Interface : V call() throws Exception;
	
			📌 Key Points
				✔ Returns a result
				✔ Can throw checked exception
				✔ Used with ExecutorService
				✔ Introduced in Java 5
				
				
41. ✅ What is Intrinsic Lock in Java?

	==> An intrinis lock is the internal moniter lock that every java object has, 
		which automatically aquired and released when a tread enters and exit syncronized block
		
		EG : 🧠 Key Points
				✔ Every Java object has one intrinsic lock
				✔ Managed automatically by JVM
				✔ Used by synchronized
				✔ Only one thread can hold it at a time
				✔ Ensures mutual exclusion + visibility
				
	==> class Counter {
	
			public synchronized void increment() {
					System.out.println("Thread safe operation");
				}
			}
			
			When thread enters increment():
			👉 Acquires intrinsic lock of Counter object (this)
			👉 Executes method
			👉 Releases lock after completion

42. ✅ What is Race Condition?
	==> A race condtion happens when multiple threads compete to update shared data without proper synchronization,
		causing unpredicatble output
		
	==> to avoid this we can synchronized keyword 
		Eg :
		public void increment() {
			synchronized(this) {
				count++;
			}
		}
		
43. End-to-end flow of how an Entity class eventually becomes a table in the database (JPA → Hibernate → SQL)

	==> When Spring Boot starts, it scans entity classes and passes metadata to Hibernate through JPA. 
		Hibernate generates SQL based on entity mappings and ddl-auto configuration, 
		and executes it via JDBC to create database tables.

	
44. 🧠 Internal Working for @Repository

	==> It:
		1️. Creates proxy around class
		2️. Adds exception translation interceptor
		3️. Catches DB exceptions
		4️. Converts to Spring standard exceptions
		
		
45. What happens if both @Service and @Repository are used on the same class
		
		@Service
		@Repository
		public class UserServiceRepository {
		}

	==> | Aspect                | Result                         |
		| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
		| Bean Creation         | One bean only                  |
		| App Crash             | ❌ No                           |
		| Exception Translation | ✅ Yes (because of @Repository) |
		| Recommended           | ❌ No                           |
		
		
46. Why ConcurrentHashMap exists and when to use it ?
	==> ✅ Why ConcurrentHashMap Was Introduced

			To provide:
			✔ Thread safety
			✔ High concurrency
			✔ Better performance
			✔ Lock-free reads
			✔ Fine-grained locking
			
47. Global exception handler

	@RestControllerAdvice
	public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

		@ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
		public ResponseEntity<String> handleGenericException(Exception ex) {

			return new ResponseEntity<>(
					"Internal Server Error",
					HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
			);
		}
	}


========================================

	=== Java script ============

1. 	console.log('A');
	setTimeout(() => console.log('B'), 0);
	Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('C'));
	console.log('D');
	
	o/p: A, D, B, C
	
2. for(var i=0;i<3;i++){
		setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
	} // 3,3,3,   but If use let it will become local variable 1,2,3
	
	
3. how do you use this inside Object'
	=> const obj = {
		name : "manju",
		getName(){
		return console.log(this.name);
	  }
	}
	obj.getName();
	
	
4. How to write api without Http
	Eg: fetch("")
		.then(
			res => console.log(res)
		)
		.catch(err-> {
			console.log(err)
		})
		
5. PromiseAll() -> It will take array of promise and return single promise out of it 
	let p1 = Promise.resolve(10);
	let p2 = Promise.resolve(12);
	let p3 = Promise.resolve(15);

	Promise.all([p1,p2,p3]).then(
	  res => console.log(res) // [10,12,15]
	).catch(err => {
	  console.log(err);
	})
	
	if one of the promise faile Eg: let p2 = Promise.reject(12);
	=> it will go to error section and print only 12
	
6. const arr = [1, [2, [3, 4]], 5];

	function flattenArray(array){
	  let result = []
	  array.forEach(element => {
		if(Array.isArray(element)){
		   result = result.concat(flattenArray(element));
		}else{
		  result.push(element)
		}
	  });
	   return result;
	}
	console.log(flattenArray(arr)); //[1,2,3,4,5]
	
7. remove duplicate key's object in given array
	=> let arr = [
		 {id:1,name:'A'},
		 {id:2,name:'B'},
		 {id:1,name:'C'}
		]
		
		let newMap = new Map();
		arr.forEach(item => {
			if(!newMap.has(item.id)){
				newMap.set(item.id, Item)
			}
		})
		
		console.log(Array.from(newMap.values()))
	 
	


2. Stream API questions

				if(arr[i] != 0){
					int temp = arr[i];
					arr[i] = arr[j];
					arr[j] = temp;
					
					j++
					
				}
			 }
			 
			 Arrays.sort(arr,0,j)
			 
			 (or)
			 
			int[] arr = {22, 12, 45, 0, 0, 60, 0};
			int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
			int k = 0;
			for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

				employees.stream()
						 .mapToDouble(Employee::getSalary)
						 .average()
						 .orElse(0.0);

				System.out.println(averageSalary);
				
21. Find out all the numbers starting with 1 using stream function
	
		 List<Integer> list = List.of(11, 18, 20, 24, 85, 66, 13);
		 System.out.println(list.stream().filter(l-> String.valueOf(l).startsWith("1")).collect(Collectors.toList()));

22. compare two array order not important


		int[] arr1 = {3, 2, 5, 7};
		int[] arr2 = {2, 3, 5, 7};

		Arrays.sort(arr1);
		Arrays.sort(arr2);

		boolean isSame = Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2);

		System.out.println(isSame);
		
23. Find the special char in given string

		String str = "Java@123#Dev!";

		for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {

			if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(ch)) {
				System.out.print(ch + " ");
			}
		} 
		
24. Convert 1st half to Lowercase and 2nd half to uppercase
		 
		String str = "JaVaProGraM";
        int mid = str.length()/2;
        String firstHalf = str.substring(0, mid).toLowerCase();
        String secondHalf = str.substring(mid, str.length()).toUpperCase();
        System.out.println(firstHalf + secondHalf);


25. Get the highest paid Employee on each dept 

		List<Empolyee> emp = List.of(
            new Empolyee(20, "abc", 5000,"IT"),
            new Empolyee(21, "xyz", 6000,"HR"),
            new Empolyee(22, "pqr", 3000,"HR"),
            new Empolyee(23, "nmc", 4000,"IT")
		);


        Map<String, Optional<Empolyee>> collect = emp.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Empolyee::getDept,
                Collectors.maxBy(Comparator.comparingDouble(Empolyee::getSalary))));

        collect.forEach( (a, b) -> System.out.println(a + " => "  + b.get().getName() ));
		
26. Find the words starting with vowels
		String str = "Urrah! java my code is working!";
		
        System.out.println(Arrays.stream(str.split(" "))
                .filter(w -> "AEIOUaeiou".indexOf(w.charAt(0)) != -1)
                .collect(Collectors.toList()));
				
27.  get the employee details for each dept
		 List<Empolyee> emp = List.of(
            new Empolyee(20, "abc", 5000,"IT"),
            new Empolyee(21, "xyz", 6000,"HR"),
            new Empolyee(22, "pqr", 3000,"HR"),
            new Empolyee(23, "nmc", 4000,"IT")
		);

        Map<String, List<Empolyee>> deptMap = emp.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Empolyee::getDept));

        deptMap.forEach((dept, empList) -> {

            System.out.println("Department: " + dept);

            empList.forEach(emp1 ->
                    System.out.println("Name: " + emp1.getName()
                            + ", Salary: " + emp1.getSalary())
            );

            System.out.println();
        });
		
28. get the employee who earn above average salary

			double average = emp.stream().mapToDouble(Empolyee::getSalary).average().orElse(0);
			emp.stream().filter(l-> l.getSalary() > average).forEach(l-> System.out.println(l.getName()));


29. If you add a null value to an empty Set, what will be the size?

        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add(null);
        System.out.println(set.size());	//1  same for List aswell


		
== Introduction ====
	
Hi, I’m Roy. I have around 5.5 years of experience as a Full Stack Developer working mainly with Angular and Spring Boot.
Currently, I’m working on an insurance domain product where I build scalable frontend modules using Angular 
and Nx UI components and develop backend microservices using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and REST APIs.

My key responsibilities include designing reusable UI components, handling complex reactive forms, responsiveness apps using bootstrap
integrating APIs, implementing business logic, optimizing performance, and ensuring secure communication between services.

I also have experience with Docker for containerizing applications and basic AWS services like EC2 and S3 for deployment.
